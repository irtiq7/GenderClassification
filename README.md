# GenderClassification
This is my first attempt to machine learning.

The following code is feed a training set data based on [height, weight, shoe size]. 
The algorithm then trains the classifier and makes an attempt to predict the outcome
of the given data while matching the prediction with the actual answer.

    import sklearn
    import numpy
